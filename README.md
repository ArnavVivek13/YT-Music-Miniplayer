YT Music Miniplayer

A lightweight desktop overlay mini-player for YouTube Music built with Electron.
The application embeds YouTube Music inside an Electron window and provides a floating always-on-top mini player that appears when the main window is minimized.

The mini player allows you to control playback, view song metadata, and interact with the player without keeping the full window open.

---

Overview

This project creates a custom desktop experience for YouTube Music by combining:

- Electron's multi-window architecture
- Secure IPC communication
- DOM extraction of player metadata
- A floating overlay UI

The application consists of two main windows:

1. Main Window
   
   - Hosts the YouTube Music web app inside a "webview".

2. Overlay Miniplayer
   
   - A small floating control panel that shows the current song and playback controls.

When the main window is minimized, the overlay appears.
Clicking the overlay restores the full player.

Features

Floating Overlay Player

- Always-on-top miniplayer
- Appears automatically when the main window is minimized
- Can be dragged across the screen

Playback Controls

From the overlay you can control:

- Play / Pause
- Next Track
- Previous Track

These actions are forwarded to the YouTube Music web player via IPC.

---

Live Song Metadata

The overlay displays:

- Song title
- Artist name
- Current playback time
- Album artwork

This information is extracted directly from the YouTube Music DOM.

---

Dynamic Background

The overlay background dynamically adapts to the current song:

- Album cover is used as a blurred background
- CSS effects produce a gradient glass-like card

---

Lightweight

- No heavy frameworks
- Built with Vanilla JS + Electron
- Small codebase and minimal dependencies

---

UI Overview

Main Player

The main window hosts YouTube Music.

It is a full desktop wrapper around:

https://music.youtube.com

This is embedded using an Electron "webview".

---

Overlay Miniplayer

The overlay displays:

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Song Title                  │
│ Artist           ◁  || ▷   │
│ 0:31 / 3:45                 │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Features:

- Always on top
- Frameless window
- Blurred album cover background
- Rounded card interface

---

Architecture

The project uses a multi-layer IPC architecture:

Overlay UI
   ↓
overlay_preload.js
   ↓
Main Process (main.js)
   ↓
main_preload.js
   ↓
index.html
   ↓
YouTube Music webview
   ↓
yt_preload.js

Each layer communicates through Electron IPC channels.

---

IPC Workflow

The application uses several IPC channels to allow communication between windows.

---

1. Song Data Flow

Purpose:
Send current track information from YouTube Music to the overlay.

Flow:

YouTube Music DOM
      ↓
yt_preload.js
      ↓
ipcRenderer.send("forward-song-data")
      ↓
main.js
      ↓
overlayWin.webContents.send("song-data")
      ↓
overlay_preload.js
      ↓
miniplayer.html

Result:

The overlay updates the UI with the latest song metadata.

---

2. Playback Controls

Purpose:
Allow the overlay to control the YouTube Music player.

Flow:

miniplayer.html
      ↓
overlay_preload.js
      ↓
ipcRenderer.send("playback-event")
      ↓
main.js
      ↓
mainWindow.webContents.send("playback-event")
      ↓
index.html
      ↓
webview.send("control")
      ↓
yt_preload.js
      ↓
DOM button click

Result:

The overlay buttons directly control the YouTube Music player.

File Explanations

main.js

The Electron main process.

Responsibilities:

- Creates the main application window
- Creates the overlay window
- Handles IPC routing between windows
- Manages window lifecycle events

Key behaviors:

- Show overlay when minimized
- Close overlay when restored
- Forward IPC messages

---

main_preload.js

Secure bridge between:

Main Renderer ↔ Main Process

Exposes safe APIs like:

- playback control listener

---

index.html

The renderer page for the main window.

Contains the YouTube Music webview.

Responsibilities:

- Load YouTube Music
- Forward commands to the webview
- Receive playback commands from the overlay

---

yt_preload.js

Injected into the YouTube Music webview.

Responsibilities:

- Extract player information from the DOM
- Detect playback state
- Trigger DOM events for playback controls
- Send song data back to the app

Example extracted data:

title
artist
current time
album artwork
play/pause state

---

miniplayer/miniplayer.html

The overlay UI.

Displays:

- Song metadata
- Playback controls

Also handles UI events like:

prev
pause
next

---

overlay_preload.js

Secure bridge for the overlay window.

Responsibilities:

Expose safe functions:

sendControl()
onSongData()

This prevents the renderer from directly accessing Node APIs.

---

styles.css

Defines the miniplayer appearance.

Features:

- Dynamic blurred album cover background
- Dark translucent UI
- Responsive layout

---

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ArnavVivek13/YT-Music-Miniplayer.git
cd YT-Music-Miniplayer

Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the application:

npm start

---

Building the Executable

Create a Windows build:

npm run build:win

The executable will appear in the "dist" folder.

---

Technologies Used

- Electron
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication)

---

Disclaimer

This project is an unofficial wrapper for YouTube Music.

It is intended for educational and personal use.

---

Future Improvements

Possible enhancements:

- Media key support
- System tray controls
- Volume integration
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Cross-platform builds
